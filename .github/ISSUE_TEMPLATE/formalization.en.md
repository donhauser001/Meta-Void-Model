## 📊 Proposed Formalization

### Mathematical Framework

> Select or propose appropriate mathematical framework

- [ ] Set Theory
- [ ] Category Theory
- [ ] Probability Theory
- [ ] Differential Geometry
- [ ] Information Theory
- [ ] Quantum Mechanics Formalism
- [ ] Other: _______________

### Formal Definition

```latex
% Utilize LaTeX syntax
\theta : \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{I})
\text{where } \mathcal{M} \text{ is the Meta-Void manifold}
\text{and } \mathcal{I} \text{ is the set of potentiality interfaces}
```

### Key Properties / Axioms

```latex
% Enumerate properties the formalization must satisfy
1. \forall \theta \in \Theta, \exists S : S = f(\theta, \omega, O)
2. ...
```

## 💻 Computational Implementation (optional)

> Algorithmic implementation proposals if applicable

```python
class ConsciousnessPath:
    """
    Formal representation of θ (theta) path
    """
    def __init__(self, history: List[State], attention_weights: Dict):
        self.history = history
        self.attention = attention_weights
    
    def sample_interface(self, potentiality_field: PotentialityField) -> Interface:
        """
        Process of θ path sampling interfaces within potentiality field
        """
        pass
```
