## 🎯 Target Axiom / Module

> Specify precisely which axiom identifier or module path is subject to falsification

- **Axiom ID**: (e.g., `M.0`, `C.3`, `S.2`, `F.1`)
- **Module Path**: (e.g., `core/meta-void/tension-structure.md`)
- **Specific Claim**: 

```
Paste the specific statement from original text
```

## ⚔️ Refutation Argument

### 1. Logical Contradiction (if applicable)

> Identify logical conflicts between target axiom and other axioms within the model

```
Axiom X states: ...
Axiom Y states: ...
These two axioms contradict because: ...
```

### 2. Derivation Error (if applicable)

> Identify logical gaps within the reasoning chain from premises to conclusion

```
Premise 1: ...
Premise 2: ...
Claimed Conclusion: ...
Error in Step N: ...
```

### 3. Empirical Falsification (if applicable)

> Identify conflicts with established scientific facts or reproducible experiments

**Known Fact / Experiment**: 
**Citation**: (paper/textbook reference)
**How it contradicts MVM**:

## 📐 Formal Representation (optional)

> Express falsification using formal logic or mathematical language if possible

```
∀x (P(x) → Q(x))  [MVM Claim]
∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x)) [Counterexample]
Therefore: ¬∀x (P(x) → Q(x))
```

## 🔄 Proposed Resolution (optional)

> If modification rather than complete refutation is deemed possible, provide proposal

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] Complete content of relevant modules has been reviewed
- [ ] Argument is grounded in logic rather than emotion or belief
- [ ] Specific axiom identifiers or original text passages have been cited
- [ ] Distinction between "logical error" and "inconsistency with personal worldview" has been maintained
