# Contributing to MVM

[![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/中文-版本-blue)](../zh/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Thank you for your interest in **Meta-Void-Model (MVM)**.

This repository is not merely a gallery for theory display, but an open **logical stress-testing arena**. As this model attempts to establish cross-disciplinary connections between physics, information theory, and phenomenology, I am acutely aware that any single individual's perspective inevitably has limitations.

I invite explorers with rational and rigorous attitudes to participate in this model's evolution through the following channels.

---

## 01. Participation Principles

Before contributing, please ensure you agree with the following principles:

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logic First** | I welcome any challenges to the theory, but please base them on logical derivation rather than intuitive insights |
| **Terminology Alignment** | In discussions, please use definitions from this project's Glossary whenever possible, or explicitly provide your own definitions |
| **Non-Mystification** | Although we discuss consciousness, I reject supernatural descriptions lacking logical support. Please maintain academic restraint |

---

## 02. Contributions I Seek (Areas of Focus)

Currently focusing on breakthroughs in the following directions:

### A. Logical Falsification

If you discover **"Logical Break Points"** or self-contradictions within the theoretical framework, please submit an Issue.

> **This is the highest-level contribution to this project.**

### B. Mathematical Formalization

Currently, the interaction between $\theta$ (consciousness path) and $\omega$ (spectrum) remains at conceptual description stage. I seek contributions that can provide rigorous mathematical descriptions using the following tools:

- **Category Theory**: Describing morphisms from Non-existence field to manifestation state
- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Studying topological properties of consciousness paths within Meta-Void tension structure
- **Information Theory**: Quantifying compression and information loss in snapshot rendering process

### C. Physics and Neuroscience Mapping (Interdisciplinary Mapping)

Seeking correlations between MVM model and existing experimental evidence, such as:

- Explanation paths for **delayed-choice experiments** in quantum mechanics within MVM
- Analogies between "restricted perception" in neuroscience and MVM's "sampling mechanism"

## 03. Contribution Process

### Submitting Issues

| Label | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `[Refutation]` 🔴 | **Challenge**: Clearly describe logical contradiction points |
| `[Suggestion]` 🔵 | **Suggestion**: Explain how the suggestion enhances model's explanatory power |
| `[Inquiry]` 🟢 | **Inquiry**: Seek explanation for unclear concepts |

### Submitting Pull Requests (PR)

- **Documentation Revision**: If you find typographical errors or ambiguous expressions, PRs are welcome
- **New Sections**: If you wish to contribute new perspectives to `Appendix/` or `Theory/`, please first discuss logical consistency via Issue
- **Code/Symbolization**: Contributions of code implementations for model parameterization (Python / Mathematica, etc.) are welcome

---

## 04. Discussion Channels

For unstructured, divergent thinking, please use GitHub's **Discussions** board.

The following categories are established:

| Category | Topic |
|----------|-------|
| `#The-Void` | Philosophical exploration of "Non-existence" essence |
| `#Rendering-Logic` | Physics/mathematics discussion on snapshots and discrete reality |
| `#Experience-Echo` | Case analysis of first-person consciousness experience |
