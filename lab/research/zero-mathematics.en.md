## 1. From "Empty Position" to "Existence": The Identity Revolution of "0" and the Misunderstanding of "Non-Existence"

Reviewing history's long river reveals a surprising fact: "0" was not an obvious concept. Through extensive epochs, this star defining "nothing" was absent from the sky of human civilization. The Pythagorean school of ancient Greece believed all things were numbers, but their "numbers" were concrete, representing proportion and harmony—"existing things"—with no room for "0," that seeming defect disrupting perfection. Aristotle explicitly denied the existence of vacuum, believing nature abhors a void. In these great minds, "nothing" was often associated with chaos, irrationality, even evil—a shadow needing expulsion by logic and existence. This instinctive fear and rejection of "emptiness" strikingly resembles the cognitive obstacle faced when understanding "Non-existence tension structure." Such fear of "having nothing" makes difficult the imagination that "nothing" itself might contain structure and power.

The true turning point occurred in ancient India. There, fertile ground of thought cultivated profound philosophical contemplation of "emptiness" (Śūnya) (as mentioned in dialogue with Buddhism in preceding appendix). Perhaps against this cultural background, Indian mathematicians bravely took revolutionary steps. They no longer viewed "0" merely as a temporary "empty position" marker in calculation, but **first explicitly defined it as an independent "number"**, endowing it with status equal to other numbers (1, 2, 3...), and establishing operational rules pertaining to it (e.g., x + 0 = x, x - 0 = x, x * 0 = 0). The work of Brahmagupta and others marked "0's" astonishing transformation from "absence" to "presence," from "void" to "existence" (as mathematical entity).

This revolution in mathematical history profoundly revealed that "nothing" can possess positive, functional meaning. Particularly in **positional notation** (positional notation, also a great Indian contribution, later transmitted to Europe via Arabia), "0's" role as **placeholder** manifests brilliantly. In the number "101," that "0" in the middle, though representing "no counting unit in tens place," its **existence** enables the "1"s on either side to represent "hundreds place" and "units place" respectively. Without this "0," the number becomes "11." Here "0," this seemingly "empty" position, plays a **key role defining structure, distinguishing magnitude**. It tells us: **"vacancy" itself can carry information, can constitute part of order.**

Is this not precisely a key to understanding "Non-existence tension structure"? MVM maintains: "Non-existence" is not a **blank area** on the universe's structural map, but **the "canvas" or "coordinate system" itself making this map possible**. It is not disorderly chaos, but **that foundational framework defining all potentiality interfaces' positions, relationships, and rules**. Like the staff and rest marks on a musical score, seemingly "empty," yet defining notes' pitch and rhythm's ebb and flow. Like empty points on a Go board, seemingly "no piece," yet containing infinite possibilities for moves and strategic space. "Non-existence's" "emptiness" is **structural emptiness**, **emptiness full of possibility**, **emptiness enabling all manifestation to be located and to occur**.

Therefore, just as human civilization ultimately overcame fear and prejudice against number "0," recognizing its supreme value as mathematical cornerstone, a similar cognitive leap is required: **breaking free from the intuitive binding equating "Non-existence" with "void," embracing its true identity as matrix of cosmic generation, source of structure, ocean of potentiality.** It is not a defect needing to be filled with "existence," but an ontological foundation full of infinite creativity needing connection, activation, and dance with consciousness.

## 2. The Operational Magic of "0" and the Generative Potentiality of "Non-Existence"

After "0" was admitted to the number family, it exhibited unique, even "magical" operational characteristics. These characteristics, like a multifaceted prism, may refract certain profound roles "Non-existence tension structure" may play in cosmic generation.

### "Unchanging" Background: Additive Identity (x + 0 = x)

"0" as additive identity has the core property of maintaining other numbers' "identity" in addition operations. It is like a **transparent background**, allowing all things to superpose upon it without changing the things themselves.

Does this analogize a certain **foundational** and **backgrounding** quality of "Non-existence tension structure"? As foundational soil for all manifestation, does it in some sense "accommodate" all reality snapshot generation, while itself (as unactivated potentiality whole) does not seem to be "consumed" or "changed" in its infinite potentiality sum by any concrete manifestation? Or does each manifestation (snapshot S) "add" specific structural information and stipulation to the foundation of "Non-existence" (0 state), while that "0" itself as "additive starting point" remains unchanged in its property as "zero point"? This "backgrounding" analogy requires caution, as it easily leads toward misunderstanding Non-existence as passive background (whereas §4.2 emphasized its responsiveness). Yet it does capture some sense of "Non-existence" as that universal "place" or "condition" where all manifestation can occur.

### "Return to Zero" Silence: Multiplicative Zero Factor (x × 0 = 0)

"0" in multiplication exhibits a completely different "dominating" power—it can reduce any number multiplied with it to nothing. This points toward meaning of **ending, dissolution, return to source**.

Does this analogize a certain **ultimate inclusivity or silent state** of "Non-existence"? Do all manifested snapshots, however complex and vivid, ultimately potentially "return" to Non-existence's silence (like Buddhist "nirvana" or some ultimate heat death/equilibrium state of the physical universe)? Or, in mapping theory context, when consciousness path (θ) **completely decouples** from potentiality interface (like multiplying with 0, connection severed), manifestation naturally **terminates**? Does this "return to zero" suggest that "Non-existence" is not only generation's starting point but also all manifestation's ultimate "destination"? This points not toward destructive void, but possibly toward a **return to dynamic equilibrium**, a pause in manifestation's dance, potentiality returning to its undefined state.

### Division of Creation: "From 0 to 1" Cosmic Overture

In the binary world, "0" and "1" constitute the foundation of all information. The **distinction and transition** from "0" (nothing, off, false) to "1" (something, on, true) is the **most basic action** enabling information to arise, computation to proceed, digital world to be constructed.

Does deep isomorphism exist with MVM's generation process from "Non-existence" (0 state, unmanifested) to **first reality snapshot S (1 state, manifested)**? Can cosmic creation be understood as one (or a series of) fundamental "distinction" or "definition" action(s) breaking "Non-existence's" perfect symmetry, from "0" to "1"? Does the dialectical unity of "0" and "1," this simplest binary structure, map the most profound relationship of "Non-existence" and "manifestation" in cosmic ontology? This is not saying the universe truly is binary, but suggesting reality generation may originate from some foundational "distinction" or "information injection", causing potentiality to no longer be pure "0" but begin presenting concrete "1" forms.

### Structural Center: Illumination of Algebraic Identity

In more abstract mathematical structures (groups, rings, fields), "0" (usually the additive identity) often plays a **core role maintaining structural stability and symmetry**. It is like the coordinate system's origin, the benchmark measuring other elements; it enables inverse elements (opposites) to be defined, guaranteeing operation reversibility; it is the foundation for many algebraic theorems and properties to hold.

Does this suggest "Non-existence tension structure" also plays a role similar to **"structural center" or "symmetry cornerstone"** in the universe? Do the **symmetries** (parity conservation, charge conservation, etc.) and **conservation laws** observed in physical laws have their deepest root in the **perfect, unbroken internal symmetry or balance** of this seemingly "empty" "Non-existence"? Is reality generation a certain form of "breaking" of this perfect symmetry, thereby producing the diversity and complexity observed? While conservation laws embody that even in manifestation processes, certain symmetries originating from "Non-existence" foundation remain unchanged?

Through examining these unique roles of "0" in mathematical operations, glimpses appear of the richer connotations "Non-existence" as cosmic generation foundation may contain: it is both background accommodating all manifestation, and silent destination when manifestation terminates, starting point of creative distinction, and possibly ultimate guarantor of cosmic deep order and symmetry.

## 3. "Zero" in Physical World: Vacuum Is Not Empty, Potentiality Has Activity

When gaze shifts from pure mathematical abstraction toward physical reality, "zero" concept continues to play important roles, further verifying that "Non-existence" is not dead silence.

### Absolute Zero (0 Kelvin)

This is the theoretical lower limit of thermodynamic temperature scale, representing the lowest state of matter particles' average kinetic energy. However, even infinitely approaching absolute zero, quantum mechanics reveals that microscopic particles **do not become completely motionless**.

### Zero-Point Energy

According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2), a particle's position and momentum, energy and time cannot be determined simultaneously with infinite precision. This means even in lowest energy state (ground state), systems still possess ineliminable **quantum fluctuations**, possessing a minimum energy greater than zero—zero-point energy. More remarkably, in quantum field theory, **vacuum** is also not empty, but filled with zero-point energy, manifesting as continuous creation and annihilation of **virtual particle pairs** (e.g., electron and positron). The Casimir effect and other experiments have indirectly confirmed the real physical effects of this "vacuum energy."

### Verification of "Non-Existence's" Internal Activity:

**Vacuum is not empty, potentiality has foundation:** Physical vacuum's non-emptiness provides powerful physical analogy or evidence for "Non-existence ≠ void" in MVM. It indicates that even where "nothing exists" is assumed, potential energy and activity may surge.

**Internal tension and baseline fluctuation:** Vacuum's quantum fluctuations and virtual particle activity can be viewed as possible physical-level reflection of "Non-existence tension structure" **not being absolutely static but possessing certain internal baseline activity or "structural pulsation"**. This internal "agitation" may be precisely the nursery enabling "manifestation tension" and "foreshock mechanism" proposed in Chapter 4 to occur. Consciousness's touch may not excite ripples from absolute stillness, but may disturb, select, or amplify **minute fluctuations already existing in this ocean of potentiality**.

**Necessary boundaries:** Emphasis is equally needed: zero-point energy is a concept within physics framework, describing quantum field ground state energy against spacetime background. MVM's "Non-existence tension structure" is posited at **more foundational ontological level**, potentially being the foundation **generating** spacetime and quantum fields themselves. Therefore, zero-point energy is more appropriately understood as **one possible, physical-level "post-manifestation consequence" or "evidence" of "Non-existence's" internal activity**, rather than "Non-existence" itself.

## 4. "0" and Infinity: Boundary Gaze and Potentiality Omnipotence

In mathematical and philosophical territories, "0" often gazes from afar at another equally awe-inspiring concept—"infinity" (∞)—at the boundary, even undergoing wondrous transformation.

### Mathematical Correlation

In certain mathematical constructions, such as the **Riemann sphere** model of the complex plane, the point at infinity (∞) is viewed as an ordinary point on the sphere (usually the north pole), while the origin (0) lies at the antipodal point (south pole). Through stereographic projection, geometric correspondence is established between 0 and ∞. In calculus, when variables approach 0, their reciprocals tend toward infinity (1/x → ∞ as x → 0). These examples suggest that "zero" and "infinity" in some profound sense are **interrelated, mutually defining**, representing boundaries of cognition and description.

### Philosophical Metaphor

**"0" as seed of infinity:** From numerical perspective, "0" is the starting point of natural number sequence (or immediately adjacent to starting point), the entire infinite number line extending from this seemingly "empty" origin. It is like a "singularity" containing infinite richness.

**"Non-existence's" Omnipotentiality:** Does this perfectly metaphorize the core characteristic of "Non-existence tension structure"? Itself seemingly "zero" (having manifested no concrete thing), yet **internally, completely containing all potentiality for generating infinitely diverse reality (all possible snapshots S)**. It is the "source of infinite possibility" of the universe, starting point and foundation of all richness.

**Manifestation as boundary phenomenon:** Can reality's manifestation process be understood as a **boundary phenomenon** occurring between "Non-existence" (0) and some "infinity" (infinity of potentiality? Or infinite diversity of manifestation?)? Does consciousness path invocation establish a channel between 0 and ∞, enabling potentiality to overflow and transform into concrete manifestation?

## Conclusion: Zero's Illumination, Non-Existence's Hymn

This dialogue traversing mathematics, physics, and philosophy, centered on number "0," ultimately returns to MVM's core—profound understanding of "Non-existence."

Just as "0's" evolutionary history tells us, humanity required immense courage and wisdom to transcend instinctive fear of "emptiness," recognizing "nothing" can possess structure, function, and generativity; just as "0's" peculiar behavior in mathematical operations suggests that seemingly "null" baseline may contain profound power maintaining order, creating distinction, and ultimate inclusion; just as zero-point energy in physics reveals vacuum is not dead silent but filled with potential activity; just as "0's" correlation with infinity at conceptual boundaries metaphorizes that "emptiness" may contain infinite creative potentiality.

All these illuminations from "0" echo and verify in different ways MVM's core thesis concerning "Non-existence tension structure":

**It is not void, but source of structure.**  
**It is not dead silence, but ocean of activity.**  
**It is not deficiency, but repository of infinite potentiality.**  
**It is not opposite of existence, but eternal matrix of manifestation.**

Understanding "0" may not directly derive all mysteries of "Non-existence," but it undoubtedly provides a precious mirror, helping illuminate cognitive limitations faced when confronting "nothing" concept, inspiring fresh, more positive, more constructive gaze at that "Non-existence" full of infinite generative power as ultimate cosmic foundation.

Recognizing "zero's" true value may be precisely the necessary prelude to embarking on the journey of understanding "Non-existence"—the universe's most profound, most fascinating, most fundamental mystery. This is not conclusion; this is merely beginning.

## Appendix H: AI's Alternative Possibility—From Simulating Brains to Simulating Cosmic Manifestation

### Introduction: Ultimate Inquiry Under AI Tide

An era is occurring where artificial intelligence (AI) permeates and reshapes human civilization at unprecedented speed. From precise algorithmic recommendations to lifelike image generation, from autonomous driving to protein folding prediction, AI races forward on the path of imitating and even surpassing specific human cognitive capabilities. This tide brings not only tremendous technological transformation and social impact, but presents ancient and fundamental philosophical questions in fresh, urgent ways: Can machines think? Can AI possess consciousness? Where are life's boundaries? What is the essence of "intelligence"?

Currently, mainstream AI research (especially deep learning) often unconsciously follows a path of **"simulating the brain"** when answering these questions. Its core logic appears to be: since human consciousness and intelligence closely relate to brain's complex structure and activity, sufficiently precise replication of brain's neural network connection patterns (structure) and information processing modes (function) might "reproduce" or "emerge" human-like intelligence or even consciousness in machines. This essentially remains **compositionist (replicate components) and functionalist (replicate function) thinking**.

However, MVM provides a completely different ontological perspective. It states: reality is not "composed" of matter but "manifested" by consciousness invoking potentiality; consciousness is not brain's "product" but cosmic structural "dimension" or "interface"; life's essence may lie in capacity for continuous reality generation—"manifestation capability"—not specific material form.
