## Rationale for Preservation

1. **Source Comparison**: Modular decomposition may involve minor logical adjustments or textual deletions; original manuscript enables comparison when ambiguity arises
2. **Offline Reading**: Some readers prefer downloading complete document for continuous reading
3. **Historical Record**: Documents the origin point of MVM's evolution from "a work" to "a system"

## Recommended Reading Approach

- **First-time Reading**: Begin with modular structure from [SUMMARY.en.md](../SUMMARY.en.md)
- **Deep Research**: Reference `v3-完稿.md` for complete argumentative flow of original work
- **Offline Reading**: Download `.docx` file or check [Releases](../../releases) page for PDF version
