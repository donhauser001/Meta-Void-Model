## 1. Problem Domain Definition

### 1.1 Core Inquiry

> **Question Q₀** (Origin Question)  
> Why is reality this way, and not otherwise? Why does it appear before you at this moment, in this form?

This is not a question about "content" (what is in the world), but about "structure" (why reality manifests in this manner).

### 1.2 Three Major Cracks in Existing Paradigm

| # | Crack Name | Problem Description | Traditional Paradigm's Predicament |
|:-:|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Crack-1** | Hard Problem of Consciousness | Why do physical processes accompany subjective experience? | Cannot derive qualia from neural firing |
| **Crack-2** | Quantum Measurement Problem | How does observation cause wavefunction collapse? | Measurement problem has no consensus interpretation |
| **Crack-3** | Circular Dependency | Using consciousness to study world, yet world model cannot explain consciousness | Self-referential paradox |

```

         Traditional paradigm's understanding of "existence" is 
         fundamentally incorrect.

## 2. Paradigm Axioms

### Axiom P.0 — Existence Redefinition

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AXIOM P.0  Existence Redefinition                                     │
│                                                                         │
│  "Existence" is not the default state. "Manifestation" is the          │
│  universe's fundamental behavior.                                       │
│                                                                         │
│  Being ≠ Default_State                                                 │
│  Manifestation = Fundamental_Operation(Universe)                        │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implication**: The "reality" we experience does not pre-exist somewhere waiting to be discovered, but is dynamically generated through specific mechanisms.

### Axiom P.1 — Particle as Projection

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AXIOM P.1  Particle as Projection                                     │
│                                                                         │
│  Particles are not universe's "bricks," but projection "pixels"        │
│  of manifestation.                                                      │
│                                                                         │
│  Particle ≠ Building_Block                                             │
│  Particle = Projection_Pixel(MetaVoid, θ)                              │
│                                                                         │
│  where: θ = consciousness_path                                         │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Corollary**: The perfect uniformity of electrons (mass, charge, spin) is not the result of "countless molds precisely replicating," but the manifestation of "same potentiality structure invoked in same manner."

### Axiom P.2 — Consciousness as Dimension

│  Consciousness is not brain's byproduct, but universe's structural     │

│                                                                         │

│  Consciousness ∈ Structural_Dimensions(Universe)                       │
│                                                                         │
│  alongside: Space(x,y,z), Time(t)                                      │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Corollary**: You are not "subject possessing consciousness," but "dynamic path focus within consciousness network."

### Axiom P.3 — Generation Precedes Being

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AXIOM P.3  Generation Precedes Being                                  │

│  Reality is not "object out there awaiting your perception," but       │
│  "pattern generated through you."                                       │
│                                                                         │
│  Reality ≠ await_perception(Object)                                    │
│  Reality = generate(Path_θ ⊗ MetaVoid, ω, O)                           │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Corollary**: Inquiring "why reality is thus" no longer points to external world's properties, but to the generation mechanism itself.

## 4. Detailed Explanation of Cracks at Scientific Boundary

### 4.1 Crack-1: Hard Problem of Consciousness

**Phenomenon Description**:
- Neuroscience can depict complete activity map of brain
- Yet cannot explain "why there is feeling"
- Gap from physical process → subjective experience

**Named by David Chalmers**: "The Hard Problem of Consciousness"

**Traditional Paradigm's Predicament**:
```python
# Traditional paradigm's implicit assumption
class TraditionalView:
    def consciousness(self, brain_state):
        # ???
        # What is the mapping from brain_state to qualia?
        # No physical law describes this step
        return qualia  # HOW?
```

**MVM Response**: Consciousness does not need to "emerge from matter" because it is itself a structural dimension of universe. Qualia is the intrinsic phenomenological aspect necessarily accompanying reality snapshot's "rendering" in consciousness interface.

→ See [core/consciousness/spectrum-omega.md](../core/consciousness/spectrum-omega.md)

### 4.2 Crack-2: Quantum Measurement Problem

**Phenomenon Description**:
- Double-slit experiment: Electrons exhibit wave-state when unobserved, collapse to particle upon observation
- Delayed choice experiment: Observation decision seems to retroactively affect past
- Bell inequality: Non-local correlation of entangled particles

**Predicament of Traditional Interpretations**:
| Interpretation | Problem |
|----------------|---------|
| Copenhagen Interpretation | Observer's special status undefined |
| Many-Worlds Interpretation | Unfalsifiable, ontologically extravagant |
| Hidden Variables Theory | Ruled out by Bell experiments |

**MVM Response**: Collapse is not consciousness "interfering" with physical world, but consciousness parameters (θ, ω, O) participating in the generation process itself. Observation is a component of manifestation.

### 4.3 Crack-3: Self-Referential Paradox

│              of explained object                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**MVM Response**: By elevating consciousness to structural dimension with status equal to spacetime, the loop is broken. Consciousness is not world's product, but one of the conditions for world's manifestation.

## 6. Core Insights of Paradigm Shift

> **Insight 0.1** (Generation Over Discovery)  
> The world you experience was never "observed" by you, but "generated" through you.

> **Insight 0.2** (Question as Participation)  
> When you begin asking "why reality is thus," you are already participating in its manifestation process.

> **Insight 0.3** (Structure Over Content)  
> The real question is not "what is in the world," but "how does the world become this through you."

## 📚 Research & Philosophical Notes

> *This section preserves philosophical speculation and deep inquiry from the original prologue regarding "paradigm shift," serving as intuitive supplement to the formal axiomatic system.*

### Intuitive Analogies

> **Film's Frame Structure**: Imagine you are watching a film. The images on screen are fluid and continuous, characters conversing, scenery changing, you immersed within, forgetting it is actually composed of frame-by-frame images stitched together. You would not ask "why is this frame this way," because you believe the director has already designed the script. **But what if reality is also a film? What if it is not pre-recorded celluloid, but—a dynamic pattern projected onto the screen only at the moment of your gaze?**

> **Logic Behind Canvas**: Reality may not be the "content" you see before you, but the structural process of "you participated in generating it." **Just as behind a painting is not pigment and canvas, but the logic of painting; just as when code runs, the characters on screen are not the program itself, but the result of algorithm and hardware converging.**

> **Boundary of Dream and Awakening**: This question once quietly surfaced at some moment in every ordinary person's life—when you wake from a vivid dream, **doubting the boundary between dream and reality**; when facing a loved one's departure, feeling the illusory nature of time and existence; when at a moment of sudden enlightenment, perceiving the world suddenly changed to another form.

### Case Studies

**Hard Problem of Consciousness**:
> Neuroscientists can trace a neural signal's path from retina to cortex, yet cannot answer "what red feels like" or "why there is feeling." **The qualitative nature of consciousness (qualia)—that subjective, introspective experience—always escapes objective measurement.** This is the core difficulty traditional "constitutionalism" cannot explain, yet precisely the core issue "manifestationism" attempts to face directly.

**Cracks in Quantum Physics**:
> In classical physics' picture, the world is predictable—you can calculate where the apple will land using Newton's formula. **However, quantum mechanics tears open this picture: particle position is indeterminate before measurement, "observation" itself seems to participate in shaping reality.** This is traditional paradigm's most profound crack, and also the entrance for new paradigm.

### Cross-disciplinary Dialogues

**Dialogue with Parmenides**:
> Ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides inquired "what is being," establishing foundation of Western ontology. **MVM then inquires a deeper question: not "what exists," but "how does existence become experienceable"—from ontology to manifestationism.**

**Dialogue with Husserlian Phenomenology**:
> Husserl proposed "epoché"—temporarily suspending presupposition of external world's existence, directly examining conscious experience itself. **MVM can be viewed as ontological extension of phenomenology—not only examining "how consciousness experiences," but further inquiring "how is experience generated from potentiality."**

**Dialogue with Wittgenstein**:
> Wittgenstein said "the limits of language are the limits of the world." **MVM then suggests: limits of snapshot are limits of current reality—you cannot experience potentiality regions your θ path has not yet activated.**

### Open Questions

1. **First Frame Problem**: If reality is generated frame by frame, how was the "first frame" produced? Before all manifestation, did some "primordial trigger" exist?

2. **Problem of Others**: If reality is generated "through you," how is "others'" reality "synchronized" with yours? What is the ontological foundation of consensus reality?

3. **Value Problem**: In a "manifested" universe, what is the ontological status of "good" and "evil," "meaning" and "void"? If everything is generated, is there still something "genuinely important"?
