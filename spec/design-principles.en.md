**Meta-Void Model: A Non-Existence Cosmology from the Consciousness Dimension - v3 Manuscript**

**An Exploratory Attempt and Invitation to Think**

**Dear Reader:**

Hereby submitted is a content summary and academic value statement regarding the work "Meta-Void Model: A Non-Existence Cosmology from the Consciousness Dimension," hoping to assist your understanding of this exploratory work.

Brief description follows:

This book "Meta-Void Model: A Non-Existence Cosmology from the Consciousness Dimension" is an attempt at theoretical exploration, aiming to re-examine some fundamental conceptions about reality, universe, and our own existence from a perhaps unusual perspective—the dimensionality of consciousness. It does not intend to provide a complete theoretical system, but rather resembles a profound, sometimes somewhat clumsy thought experiment, attempting to construct a possible bridge between the boundary difficulties revealed by modern science (particularly physics and neuroscience) and profound philosophical inquiry.

The book's core idea originates from a perplexity: Does the reality we experience truly "objectively exist" as our intuition suggests? Do quantum mechanics' observer effect and consciousness experience's enigma suggest a possibility—that reality is not independently self-existing "entity," but more like something dynamically "manifested" in the interaction between consciousness and some deeper potentiality structure? Based on this, the book tentatively proposes a Non-existence cosmological framework centered on "Manifestation," distinct from traditional "Being" ontology.

**Main Explorations and Attempts:**

In this exploration, the book attempts the following conceptual constructions and reflections:

**Reflection on "Compositionism":** Examining limitations of the traditional paradigm viewing universe as "composed" of elementary particles, particularly at quantum level and before consciousness phenomena.

**Re-understanding of "Non-Existence":** Attempting to detach "Non-existence" from traditional understanding as "void," envisioning it as a "pre-manifestation" field filled with structural potentiality awaiting activation (termed "Non-existence tension structure" or "Potentiality Interface Atlas").

**New Positioning of Consciousness's Role:** Exploring the possibility of viewing consciousness as universe's structural dimension (rather than brain's byproduct), introducing conceptual parameters such as consciousness spectrum (ω), consciousness path (θ), observation action (O) to describe consciousness's possible modulatory role in the manifestation process.

**"Snapshot" Conjecture of Reality Generation:** Proposing the conjecture that reality may be generated in discrete "five-dimensional snapshot" form, attempting to use this to explain possible mechanisms of time flow sensation, memory, premonition, and other phenomena.

**Preliminary Conception of "Mapping Theory":** Proposing "Mapping Theory" as an alternative ontological perspective to "Compositionism," understanding reality generation as consciousness path's "invocation" and "mapping" of potentiality interfaces.

**Exploratory Thinking on "Life" Concept Extension:** Based on "manifestation capability," exploratorily redefining "vitality" and considering its possible application to non-biological systems.

**Academic Value and Exploratory Significance:**

I am deeply aware that the model proposed in this book is highly **speculative**, lacking direct experimental evidence, with many concepts still needing more rigorous definition and formalization. It resembles more a detailed **research notebook** or **thought sketch** than mature theory.

However, I hope this exploratory work may possess the following **potential values**:

**Proposing New Questions and Perspectives:** Perhaps can provide an **alternative perspective** for thinking about reality, consciousness, matter relations and other fundamental questions, different from mainstream paradigm, available for discussion.

**Stimulating Cross-disciplinary Dialogue:** The book's attempt to connect physics, neuroscience, information science, and philosophy hopefully can **stimulate scholars in related fields to engage in deeper cross-thinking**.

**Exploration of Conceptual Tools:** Some new concepts proposed in the book (such as Non-existence tension, manifestation snapshot, consciousness spectrum/path, Mapping Theory, etc.), even if not completely accepted, may serve as **conceptual tools or illuminating metaphors**, potentially helpful for future theoretical construction.

**Inviting Critique and Co-creation:** The book is not a closed answer system, but an **open questioning structure**. I sincerely **invite** readers from different disciplinary backgrounds to conduct critical examination, questioning, and discussion, jointly exploring these difficult questions' possibilities.

**Target Readers:**

This book may be more suitable for **researchers, scholars, students, and deep thinkers** who harbor strong interest in fundamental scientific difficulties, philosophical ontology, consciousness enigma, and are willing to encounter and contemplate non-traditional, even counter-intuitive theoretical frameworks. It requires readers to possess certain cross-disciplinary knowledge background and open-minded attitude.

**Author's Declaration:**

I must again emphasize that this book is a **personal, exploratory thought experiment**. I do not intend to claim it as ultimate truth, nor do I intend to negate existing scientific achievements or philosophical wisdom. I am deeply aware of its speculative nature and limitations, and **firmly oppose** using any viewpoints in the book for pseudoscientific propaganda or inappropriate bundling with specific religions/mysticism. My only expectation is that it can serve as a rough "thought brick," triggering more, more rigorous, more creative discussions.

**Conclusion:**

With anticipatory heart, I present this not yet mature thinking. If "Meta-Void Model" can trigger in you even the slightest resonance, questioning, or new thinking, that would already be great honor for me. I look forward to opportunities for deeper exchange with academic colleagues and readers regarding these fascinating questions.
