## Why Open Source a Cosmological Framework?

Traditionally, philosophical theories and cosmological frameworks exist in the form of **books**—closed, static, unidirectionally transmitted.

But MVM does not aspire to become another "work" awaiting reader worship or refutation. We choose GitHub because:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Theories should be forkable, modifiable, attackable—like software       │
│  2. Errors should be tracked (Issues), not concealed                        │
│  3. Evolution should have version history (Git), not rely on               │
│     "authoritative revision"                                                │
│  4. Contributors should be recorded (Contributors), not anonymized          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What This Is Not

Let us first clarify what MVM **is not**:

| It is not... | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| ❌ Religion | We do not demand faith, only invite logical examination |
| ❌ Replacement for scientific theory | We do not claim to replace physics, but to explore its boundaries |
| ❌ Ultimate truth | We explicitly disclose logical boundaries and unresolved questions |
| ❌ Closed system | We welcome formalization, falsification, and branching |

## What This Is

MVM attempts to be:

### 1. A "Manifestation Logic Interface"

Just as APIs define interaction protocols between software systems, MVM attempts to define the **"interface" between consciousness and reality**.

```
Traditional Ontology: What is the world "composed" of?
MVM: How does the world "manifest"? What is the interface?
```

### 2. An Extensible Thought Framework

We do not provide all answers, but rather provide:

- **Core Formula**: `S := M(ρ_S ⊗ (ω, θ, O))`
- **Axiom System**: Attackable and extensible Axioms M.x, C.x, S.x, F.x
- **Code Implementation**: `poc/mvm_simulator.py` as runnable logic demonstration

### 3. A Cross-disciplinary Dialogue Platform

MVM's language design is intentional:

| Domain | MVM Correspondence |
|--------|-------------------|
| Computer Science | Mapping, API, Snapshot, Rendering |
| Quantum Physics | Superposition, Collapse, Observer Effect |
| Buddhism | Emptiness, Dependent Origination, Non-self |
| Phenomenology | Consciousness, Intentionality, Manifestation |

This is not vagueness, but **intentional multi-entry design**—allowing researchers from different backgrounds to find their own entry points.

## What Should This Repository Be in Five Years?

We envision several possible futures:

### Scenario A: Manifestation Universe SDK

MVM becomes a "worldview SDK," used for:

- Game universe design (defining world manifestation rules)
- Interactive art (using θ paths to drive visual generation)
- AI system comparison (using MVM to explain neural network emergence)
- Virtual reality (time systems based on snapshot chains)

### Scenario B: Formalized Theory Repository

MVM's axiom system is forked by mathematicians and logicians, producing:

- Category theory version
- Measure theory version
- Quantum formalism version
- Various "falsification attack" papers

### Scenario C: Cross-disciplinary Dialogue Node

MVM becomes a "thought commons" on GitHub, where physicists, philosophers, programmers, artists:

- Submit formalization attempts
- Initiate cross-disciplinary discussions
- Construct derivative works

## How You Can Participate

| Role | Entry Point |
|------|-------------|
| **Challenger** | Use [Refutation template](../../issues/new?template=refutation.md) to point out logical errors |
| **Formalizer** | Use [Formalization template](../../issues/new?template=formalization.md) to submit mathematical definitions |
| **Developer** | Fork `poc/` code, build visualizations or extend simulator |
| **Translator** | Help improve `README.en.md` or other language versions |
| **Discussant** | Initiate cross-disciplinary dialogue in [Discussions](../../discussions) |

## Regarding "Correctness"

We do not claim MVM is "correct."

What we claim is:

1. **It is logically consistent** (at least we strive to make it so—attacks welcome)
2. **It is extensible** (axiom system can be modified and branched)
3. **It is illuminating** (at least provides new perspectives on certain questions)

If you can demonstrate its logical rupture, that is a **contribution**, not a "defeat."

## Final Invitation

> *"In this collective contemplation on manifestation, I offer not truth, but an interface for observing truth."*

If you have read this far, you are already a participant in this experiment.

Your consciousness path $\theta$ chose to access this repository. Your consciousness spectrum $\omega$ determines the depth of your understanding. And your next action—whether closing the page, submitting an Issue, or forking the code—will become your "observation confirmation" $O$ of this theory.

Welcome aboard.
